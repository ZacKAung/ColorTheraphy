                    Color therapy, also known as chromotherapy, is a form of therapy that uses color and light to treat
                    certain mental and physical health conditions. We can trace this form of therapy back to the ancient
                    Egyptians. They made use of sun-filled rooms with colored glasses for therapeutic purposes.

                    In color therapy, different colors are thought to be able to treat various conditions. Color therapists
                    believe that lack of a particular color in your body might be responsible for your living condition. Here's a
                    list of the most common colors used during color therapy and how we can use them.
